## Folder Structure

Cypress has its own folder structure within the project. The main folders include:

 - cypress/fixtures: This folder contains test data that can be used in your tests.
 - cypress/integration: This folder is where your test files (e.g., .spec.js files) should be placed.
 - cypress/plugins: This folder is used for extending or modifying Cypress behavior.
 - cypress/support: This folder contains reusable functions or commands and the index.js file, where global configurations can be added

## Writing Tests

1. **Create a new test file:**

   Create a new `.spec.js` file in the `cypress/integration` folder. Example:

   ```javascript
   describe('My First Test', () => {
     it('Does not do much!', () => {
       expect(true).to.equal(true);
     });
   });
   
2. **Run your test:**
   To run Cypress tests in a CI/CD environment, add the following script to your package.json:
   
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "cypress run"
   }

Then, configure your CI/CD pipeline to run npm test or yarn test.
